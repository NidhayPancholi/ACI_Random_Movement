# Komodo Dragon Enclosure Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates the movement and behavior of Komodo Dragons within a 3D enclosure. It models various aspects of dragon behavior, environmental factors, and visualizes the dragons' movement patterns over time using 3D heatmaps.

## Features

- 3D enclosure representation with different terrain types (normal, basking, water, hiding)
- Multiple Komodo Dragons with individual energy levels and needs
- Realistic movement patterns based on dragon needs and terrain suitability
- Temperature simulation affecting dragon behavior
- Pathfinding using Dijkstra's algorithm
- 3D visualization of movement patterns and dragon positions

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
