(c) Seven-stage analysis

1. Foraging/Hunting Behavior
At the goal formation stage, the Komodo dragon develops a goal to search the novel odor in the environment based on the instinctual pattern of hunting and eating that gets elicited by the smell released from a dispenser when in close proximity. The dragon  then moves to the planning stage, to locate the source of the scent by establishing an initial direction obtained through chemical signals received. During the specification stage, the dragon readies its sensory apparatus, especially its forked tongue, for maximum chemical detection and positions its body in an orientation most favorable to detecting the scent.

During this execution stage, the dragon does its stereotypical tongue-flicking behavior to sample air particles and moves toward the increasing scent concentration. In the perception stage, the dragon perceives the scent particles via its highly developed vomeronasal organ and processes such chemical information from the environment. From then onwards, the dragon interprets sensory information: how strong the smell is and from which direction it comes, recognizing it as a possible prey or food stimulus. In this final evaluation stage of assessment, the dragon assesses whether the source of the smell is substantial enough to continue investigating and if its movements have brought it closer to the source.


2. Environmental Navigation
At the goal formation stage, the decision to move involves a choice in the mind of the Komodo dragon towards moving to other parts of the enclosure with a motivation of multiple scent sources spread over the area. The dragon then enters the planning stage by mentally mapping out its movement through the areas with scents and choosing which it will follow. In the specification stage, the best path through the enclosure is determined, and the dragon readies itself for investigative behavior.

In the execution stage, the dragon will be moving within the available space according to the chosen scent trails while showing exploratory behavior. In the perception stage, the dragon perceives the differences in scent intensities among the zones and detects environmental changes as the dragon moves within the enclosure. The dragon further interprets this sensorial input by processing the spatial relationship of the scent sources and its location relative to the scent gradients. It is during the evaluation stage that a dragon decides whether its current position receives the stimuli it desires and also measures the success of its strategy for exploration.
This interaction results in the dragon acting upon its environment to go in the odor-filled area.




3. Learning Interaction
At the goal formation stage, the Komodo dragon is in search of its preferred type of scent motivated by its increasing ability to recognize pattern characteristics linked with a rewarding experience. This goal is informed by the dragon's evolving knowledge of its olfactory environment. The dragon then goes on to the planning stage where it recalls any past successful investigation and selects an investigation strategy based on past experience. This really indicates that the dragon can actually learn and change its behavior with time.

The dragon is positioning for possible scent investigation during this specification stage, showing that its interactions with the ASDS have refined its approach toward olfactory exploration. At the execution stage, the dragon will engage in learned patterns of investigation and carry out successful foraging behaviors honed through previous interactions with the system.
Thus, during the stage of perception, the dragon identifies scent patterns that it recognizes as familiar and finds environmental cues linked to successful foraging. This means that the dragon has now improved in differentiating between and responding to certain olfactory stimuli. During the interpretation stage, the dragon interprets the sensory input by compiling current stimuli with past experiences and managing the success or failure of its investigations. This level showcases the mental strength of the dragon in remembering from previous instances and applying that to the present scenario.

Finally, during the evaluation stage, the dragon assesses whether its behavior resulted in the desired outcome and updates its internal model of successful strategies. This final stage is critical to the continuous learning process since it allows the dragon to hone its approach to interacting with the ASDS over time.

(d) Error Analysis
1. Foraging/Hunting Behavior Errors
Slips
During the Execute stage, the dragon may miss scent particles due to environmental factors. The system responds by increasing the scent concentration and turning on dispensers in adjacent locations to create a steeper gradient for the dragon to pick up the scent detection at a nearby location once again, thus crossing the Gulf of Execution with more salient olfactory path.

Mistakes
Mistakes in the Interpret stage occur when the dragon misinterprets scent type or strength. The ASDS adjusts the scent profiles to make them more distinct from one another, creating more visible gradients for the dragon to investigate alternative sources and correct its interpretations. The system learns from these errors to further optimize its presentations in the future, improving the Gulf of Evaluation with clearer olfactory information.


Mode Errors
These mode errors result from the dragon trying to hunt while the system is under maintenance and affect the Perceive and Interpret stages. The ASDS slowly turns down scent outputs in advance of maintenance and maintains low-level background scents throughout, so the dragon is free to move into non-scent areas at will during maintenance. Following maintenance, scents are reintroduced gradually in a way that helps traverse both Gulfs by clearly communicating system state.


Description Errors
Description errors are when the dragon misinterprets the scent-reward relationship, thus affecting both the Goal Formation and Plan stages of the Cognitive Theory. The ASDS reduces difficult scent patterns and creates simple reward associations, increasing success rates for finding reward-associated scents. It initially presents direct scent-reward connections and then gradually increases the complexity of these connections. The approach thus bridges both Gulfs by making the scent-reward relationship more obvious and feedback on successful foraging behaviors clearer.

2. Environmental Navigation Errors
Slips
During the Execute stage, the Komodo dragons might take wrong turns following the scent gradient. The ASDS adjusts by reinforcing the correct scented path and generating temporary "bridge" scents. This puts the dragon back on track, bridging the Gulf of Execution with clearer olfactory cues and the Gulf of Evaluation through immediate feedback on movement choices.

Mistakes
During the Plan stage, mistakes occur when dragons pick suboptimal paths between scent zones. To address this, ASDS increases the number of unique scent pathways and zone contrasts. Having done so, it helps the dragons find efficient routes and further solidifies the choices that worked, bridging the Gulf of Execution with easier-to-read cues for route planning and the Gulf of Evaluation by reinforcing optimal navigation.


Mode Errors
Mode errors are caused by dragons expecting scents in typically active zones at inappropriate times, thus impeding the Interpret stage. ASDS prevents this through providing stable daily routines and timely transitional cues before mode switches, thus supporting dragons in learning temporal patterns of scents and overcoming both Gulfs by being in sync with the dragon's internal rhythms.


Description Errors
Description Errors Description errors happen when dragons misinterpret zone boundaries. This will hurt the Goal Formation and Specify stages since ASDS gives clearer scent boundaries with gradual transition areas, allowing dragons to learn the characteristics in different zones by themselves through exploration of said zones. This bridges the Gulf of Execution by clarifying zone distinctions and the Gulf of Evaluation by providing feedback on transitions and enhancing spatial understanding.


3. Learning Interaction Errors
Slips
During the Execution stage, the Komodo dragon might perform the right behaviors at the wrong time. The ASDS widens its reward windows and gives immediate feedback for partial success, so the dragon can retry within a longer time frame. The system, therefore, dynamically relaxes its timing requirements from success rates in bridging the Gulf of Execution to have a more relaxed time frame and the Gulf of Evaluation with more exacting feedback concerning timing.

Mistakes
During the Interpret stage, mistakes arise: The dragon associates wrong behaviors with rewards. ASDS makes behavior-reward connections clearer and reduces the complexity of reward patterns temporarily to guide the dragon to correct associations, increasing in complexity as understanding grows. This bridging helps to overcome the Gulf of Execution by simplifying required behaviors and the Gulf of Evaluation by making action-reward relationships clearer.


Mode Errors
Mode errors occur when the dragon applies learned behaviors in inappropriate contexts and so affects the Plan and Execute stages. ASDS arms its dragon with different contextual cues and distinct transition signals between modes. The system reinforces correct contextual responses, thus bridging both Gulfs by providing clearer cues as to the appropriateness of the behavior and reinforcing correct applications.


Description Errors
Description Mistakes Description errors typically indicate core misunderstandings of the interaction mechanism on the part of a dragon. The ASDS, therefore, goes back to basic training patterns and institutes step-by-step learning progressions, guiding the dragon through simplified interactions that reestablish correct knowledge. This bridges the Gulf of Execution by simplifying complex interactions and the Gulf of Evaluation through clearer feedback at each stage of the learning process.

The use of behavioral pattern recognition will make the system intelligent enough to anticipate the needs and preferences of the Komodo dragon.

5. Control Interface

Staff Interface: the design parameters associated with that interface address human visual perception and cognitive processing. Most likely this interface utilizes color coding, graphs, intuitive controls to make complex data interpretable and actionable.

AI System: Design parameters in AI systems here take into consideration physiological needs and behavioral patterns of the Komodo dragon. Sensors and actuators in this system are calibrated to detect and create environmental conditions within the range of its sensory capabilities and comfort zones.

The research indicates that proper environmental conditions significantly impact Komodo dragon health, behavior, and reproductive success[6]. The system's ability to maintain precise environmental control while allowing natural behavioral expression meets these findings. The movement tracking and environmental control systems are of most importance for the support of thermoregulatory behaviors and locomotor patterns expressed by the dragons in nature[7].
(c) Seven-stage analysis
1. Thermoregulation Behavior
This corresponds to the goal formation stage of the Komodo dragon's perception that its body needs to thermoregulate in response to physiological demands for optimal temperature. The dragon proceeds with the planning stage by specifying a desire to be in an appropriate temperature zone, comparing its current location against such a desired zone. During specification, the dragon specifies the direction of locomotion toward its preferred zone and readies itself for traversal of the thermal gradient presented by the system.

During the execution stage, the dragon moves to the selected zone of temperature and either basks or cools itself. During the perception stage, the dragon perceives temperature changes through thermoreceptors and detects environmental conditions in the new zone. Further, the animal interprets the derived sensory input, which is the processing of whether the ambient temperature satisfies physiological needs and the evaluation of comfort level in the current zone. At this stage of evaluation, the dragon will examine whether the temperature lies within the best range for its present needs and choose whether it should move to another zone

The User-Dragon interaction crosses the Gulf of Execution as it acts upon the environment in pursuit of optimal body temperature, and the Gulf of Evaluation when evaluating the effectiveness of the thermoregulation behavior, concerning physiological needs.




2. Zone Exploration
In the goal formation stage, the Komodo dragon decides to explore the available microclimates within its enclosure, driven by an innate need to map its environment. The dragon now proceeds to the planning phase, where it identifies the unexplored zones and decides on a sequence for exploring them. In the specification stage, the dragon chooses an area to research and plots how it will travel to that location.

The execution stage consists of the active investigation by the dragon of the environmental conditions in different zones that it passes through. During the perception stage, the dragon detects temperature and humidity variations across zones, detects varied substrate conditions beneath its body. Further, the dragon makes an interpretation of this sensory input, elaborating in its mind the environmental information on mapping characteristics of the zones. It would then, at this stage, reassess in detail the suitability of each zone for different needs-basking, cooling, or resting-and refresh its mental map concerning the environment.

This interaction bridges the Gulf of Execution, the dragon is acting to explore and understand its environment-and the Gulf of Evaluation in that it assesses the characteristics of each zone and its suitability in light of various physiological needs.

3. Behavioral Adaptation
During the goal formation stage, it is the aim of the Komodo dragon to identify the zones of preference through different activities. Its daily pattern of activity and physiological needs activate this process. It proceeds to the planning stage by identifying zones that best match its current behavioral needs and finding most appropriate timing for the usage of such zones. Specification stage involves selecting zone(s) to behave in particular activities such as basking, cooling down or resting, and to prepare for the transition to the zone.

The execution consists of the dragon flying to the picked zone and behaving accordingly, such as basking for thermoregulation or retreating to a cooler zone for resting. This is followed by perception, a process through which the dragon continuously senses the environmental conditions of its chosen zone and detects changes in the microclimate. Then, the dragon interprets this sensory input, learning to associate certain zones with specific activities while working out each zone's characteristics. In the final stage of evaluation, the dragon assesses how well its choice of zone has satisfied its current needs and updates its behavioral patterns in light of the assessment.

This interaction crosses the Gulf of Execution, because the dragon acts to choose and move between zones in need; it crosses the Gulf of Evaluation, where it evaluates the suitability of each zone for different activities and over time adjusts its behavior to best do so.




(d) Error Analysis
1. Thermoregulation Behavior Errors
Slips 
Within thermoregulation behavior interacting with the Smart Microclimate Zones system involve the commission of an error during the Execute stage, when a Komodo dragon incorrectly moves into a zone with the wrong temperature. The response would be that the system retains gradual temperature transitions between zones, immediate behavioral responses are tracked, and optimal temperature ranges are preserved in adjacent zones so the dragon could easily move into the correct zone if the error is realized. The system maintains sharp thermal gradients to guide navigation. This approach helps in bridging the Gulf of Execution through the provision of a forgiving environment for movement errors and the Gulf of Evaluation through the provision of immediate temperature feedback, which connects to the Perceive and Evaluate stages since the dragon recognizes the temperature mismatch.

Mistakes 
In this interaction are usually made at the Goal Formation and Plan stages, where the Komodo dragon picks up an inappropriate temperature zone given its current physiological needs. This would be mitigated through the system by monitoring time spent in potentially unsuitable conditions, adjusting adjacent zones to create more optimal gradients, and logging behavioral patterns for analysis. The response would allow the dragon to detect physiological discomfort and move it to a more suitable area. The system provides clear thermal alternatives, bridging the Gulf of Execution by offering multiple appropriate choices, and the Gulf of Evaluation by allowing the dragon to interpret environmental feedback and adjust its behavior accordingly.

Mode errors 
In the thermoregulation behavior can happen when the dragon expects certain temperature conditions during system maintenance, affecting the Interpret stage when the system state changes. It does offset this by maintaining minimal temperature changes during maintenance, giving gradual transitions where possible, and keeping at least one optimal zone available so that in periods of maintenance, the dragon can easily move to other zones. At these moments, the system maintains basic operability, thus supporting both the Gulf of Execution and Evaluation through the same environmental cues that feed into the Perceive stage as the dragon adapts to temporary changes.

Description errors 
Occur when the Komodo dragon fails to recognize zone differentiation, thus impacting the Plan and Specify stages of the interaction. The system does this by enhancing resolution of the temperature boundaries, adding environmental cues to each zone, and simplifying the pattern of thermal gradients. That way, the dragon receives distinct environmental signals while maintaining consistent characteristics for each zone. That helps in mending the Gulf of Execution by making zone distinctions more salient, and the Gulf of Evaluation by giving clearer feedback on zone transitions, hence the support of the understanding of the environment by the dragon and also connecting with the Goal Formation stage when he learns the purposes of different zones.

2. Zone Exploration Errors
Slips
These slips can occur in zone exploration interaction with Smart Microclimate Zones when the Komodo dragon enters the zone during the environmental adjustment in the Execute stage. The system will stop the adjustments while maintaining a safe temperature range, allowing only gradual transitions. This lets the dragon move, if necessary, to more stable zones as the system adjusts itself gradually. By using this approach, the dragon crosses the Gulf of Execution to the Gulf of Evaluation safely by connecting to the Perceive stage, since he detected changes in his environment.

Mistakes 
Mistakes by the Komodo dragon take place during the Plan stage, where he constantly chooses suboptimal zones. The system then interprets this pattern of zone use, manipulates environmental parameters to favor optimally used zones, and updates the learning algorithms. It helps in making the optimal zones more appealing and enhances environmental cues. In the Gulf of Execution, the system's adaptation guides the dragon toward better choices while, in the Gulf of Evaluation, he learns from his experiences in the diverse zones and moves further to the stage of Evaluate.

Mode errors 
In the zone exploration can occur when the dragon incorrectly interprets conditions of the zone during daily cycles, influencing the interpretation stage. It mitigates this by following the same pattern every day, thereby making transitions in the environment predictable and signaling the imminence of a change until it fully materializes through gradual adjustments. This enables the dragon to adapt to regular patterns over time. Temporal consistency in the system serves to bridge both the Gulf of Execution and Evaluation, providing clear cues about environmental states that connect to the Perceive and Interpret stages as the dragon learns to anticipate daily cycles in the environment.

Descriptional errors
They arise when the Komodo dragon fails to understand the relationships between zones, affecting the Goal Formation and Plan stages of the interaction. Simplification of environmental patterns creates more distinct transitions between zones and enhances the defining characteristics within each zone, therefore allowing refinement in the approach of the proposed system to provide the dragon with an intuitive environmental layout with consistent zone characteristics. This will help bridge the Gulf of Execution by making the distinctions of zones more apparent and the Gulf of Evaluation by offering clearer feedback upon the transitions of zones, thereby supporting spatial understanding by the dragon and connecting to the Specify stage in its learning of spatial relationships within the enclosure.
